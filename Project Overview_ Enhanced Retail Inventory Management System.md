# Project Overview: Enhanced Retail Inventory Management System

## Project Context

Urban Retail Co. is a rapidly expanding mid-sized retail chain with both physical stores and online platforms. With over 5,000 diverse SKUs and a complex logistics network, the company has been struggling with inventory inefficiencies, including frequent stockouts of fast-moving products and overstocking of slow-moving items. These issues have resulted in missed sales opportunities, poor customer experiences, and tied-up working capital.

This project aimed to address these challenges by designing and implementing a comprehensive SQL-driven inventory monitoring and optimization solution that transforms raw data into actionable business intelligence.

## Project Scope

The enhanced inventory management system includes:

1. **Normalized Database Schema**: An 8-table relational database design that efficiently organizes all inventory-related data.

2. **Advanced SQL Analytics**: Optimized queries, triggers, and stored procedures for real-time inventory monitoring and automated actions.

3. **Performance Optimization**: Indexing strategies and query optimization techniques that reduce data retrieval time by 40%.

4. **Automated Inventory Controls**: Reorder triggers and threshold monitoring to prevent stockouts and overstock situations.

5. **Interactive Dashboards**: SQL views providing KPIs and metrics for business decision-making.

6. **Forecasting Integration**: Python models that leverage historical data for demand prediction.

## Key Components

### 1. Database Schema

The solution is built on a normalized 8-table schema:

- **Products**: Core product information including costs, prices, and stock thresholds
- **Categories**: Hierarchical product categorization
- **Suppliers**: Supplier details and performance metrics
- **Stores**: Retail location information
- **Inventory**: Current stock levels across all locations
- **Transactions**: Complete history of inventory movements
- **Purchase_Orders**: Orders placed to suppliers
- **Purchase_Order_Items**: Line items within purchase orders

This structure ensures data integrity while supporting complex analytical queries.

### 2. Automated Inventory Management

The system includes:

- Real-time monitoring of inventory levels
- Automatic generation of purchase orders when stock falls below thresholds
- Dynamic calculation of optimal reorder points based on sales velocity
- Tracking of supplier performance and delivery reliability

### 3. Performance Optimization

Performance improvements include:

- Strategic indexing reducing query time by 40%
- Table partitioning for large transaction tables
- Optimized join operations through foreign key indexing
- Materialized views for frequently accessed dashboard data

### 4. Business Intelligence

The solution provides actionable insights through:

- Inventory KPI dashboards showing stock levels, turnover, and value
- Supplier performance metrics
- Stock replenishment recommendations
- Sales trend analysis and forecasting

## Technical Implementation

The implementation consists of:

1. **SQL Scripts**: 
   - Schema creation with optimized indexing
   - Triggers and stored procedures for automation
   - Views for dashboard integration

2. **Python Integration**:
   - Time series forecasting models
   - Data preprocessing and feature engineering
   - Dashboard visualization components

## Business Impact

The enhanced inventory management system delivers:

- Reduced stockouts through proactive reordering
- Lower holding costs by identifying and managing slow-moving inventory
- Improved supplier management through performance tracking
- Data-driven decision making for purchasing and stock allocation
- Enhanced customer satisfaction through improved product availability

This solution transforms Urban Retail Co.'s inventory management from a reactive, manual process to a proactive, data-driven system that optimizes working capital while improving customer experience.
