Solving Inventory Inefficiencies
Using SQL

Introduction


Urban Retail Co. is a rapidly expanding mid-sized retail chain with a presence in both
physical stores and online platforms. We operate across several cities and offer more than
5,000 diverse stock keeping units (SKUs), ranging from daily groceries and home essentials
to electronics and personal care items. Our logistics network depends on regional
warehouses that feed inventory to individual retail outlets.

With growing complexity in operations, we are struggling to maintain optimal inventory
levels. While data from our sales transactions, product catalogs, and warehouse logs is
available, it is underutilized, leading to significant inefficiencies in inventory management.

The Challenge


Our current issues stem from reactive, manual decision-making and a lack of integrated data analytics
Frequent stockouts of fast-moving products, resulting in missed sales and poor customer
experience
Overstocking of slow-moving items, locking up working capital and increasing warehousing costs
Lack of real-time insights into SKU performance, reorder thresholds, and supplier reliability
Poor visibility across product categories, store locations, and regions.

We strongly believe that leveraging SQL-based analytics can convert our raw data into actionable
insights that will enhance our inventory management practices and decision-making process.



Your Missio
As a team of aspiring data analysts, your goal is to design and implement a SQL-driven inventory
monitoring and optimization solution. This project will simulate the core responsibilities of a data
analyst in a retail setting.



You are expected to:

Create efficient and scalable SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyze inventory and sales data
Diagnose inefficiencies, suggest corrective actions, and predict future needs based on data
Deliver both technical outputs (SQL scripts, schema designs) and analytical insights that the business
can act on.

Optimizing Revenue 

Leakage & Profitability 

in the Hospitality Sector
Introduction


In the competitive and dynamic hospitality industry, hotels and resorts often face
unexplained revenue leakages, fluctuating profitability, and underutilized service offerings.
These issues can stem from a variety of factors, such as inefficient pricing strategies, lowperforming service segments (e.g., spa, room service, event hosting), poor upselling or
cross-selling, misaligned customer targeting, or seasonal demand mismanagement.
Despite having access to guest behavior data, booking patterns, and service usage metrics,
many mid-sized hotel chains lack a systematic approach to extract actionable insights that
directly improve their revenue streams and overall business model.

Project Objective


To develop a framework that helps hospitality businesses identify root causes of revenue leakage, propose
data-backed product and pricing strategies, and justify them with business logic and forecasting models(like
Week-on-Week (WoW) and critical business KPIs like Revenue, RevPAR, Occupancy %, and ADR).

Project Components


1. Data Analysis Module
Booking trends (weekday vs. weekend, room types)
Seasonal occupancy vs. revenue correlation
Ancillary service usage (spa, meals, transport, etc.)
Customer segmentation based on spending behavior  


2. Root Cause Analysis
Identify why certain rooms or services underperform
Analyze cancellation reasons and last-minute discount patterns
Assess competitor pricing models and customer reviews

@ caciitg

3. Consulting Recommendations
New pricing and bundling strategies (e.g., couple packages, weekend getaways, corporate stays)
Product optimization (shutting down/repurposing underperforming services)
Operational tweaks (housekeeping, dynamic staffing)  


4. Business Justification
ROI and payback time for proposed changes
Scenario analysis (best case, worst case, most likely)  


5. Deliverables
Dashboard with KPIs (Average Revenue Per Available Room - RevPAR, Occupancy %, Service Revenue
Split, etc.)
Recommendation report with visual justifications
Optional: Interactive prototype on tools like Power BI/Tableau

Example Use Case


A hotel chain experiences declining profits during the off-season. You use data to show that event-hosting
spaces are underbooked and suggest pivoting to co-working spaces during weekdays. You support this with
ROI predictions and a breakdown of additional revenue expected.

Ethical Supply Chains 

in the Electronics Industry
Introduction


In today’s global economy, supply chains are no longer just logistical systems—they are
moral battlegrounds. The electronics industry, in particular, faces growing scrutiny over
labor exploitation, environmental harm, and a lack of transparency across vast, multi-tiered
supplier networks. As companies scale across borders, they inherit the challenge—and
responsibility—of ensuring their operations reflect not just efficiency, but fairness and
sustainability. High-profile cases, such as Apple’s manufacturing controversies in the early
2010s, have drawn attention to the darker side of globalization. Allegations of unsafe
working conditions, excessive overtime, and weak environmental safeguards triggered
global outrage. Apple responded with a set of bold reforms: stronger supplier codes of
conduct, detailed annual transparency reports, renewable energy initiatives, and worker
empowerment programs. While Apple’s response sparked industry-wide conversations,
many companies—especially small and mid-sized firms—still struggle to implement
meaningful, transparent, and enforceable ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance)
practices. As supply chains grow increasingly complex, the need for scalable, tech-enabled,
and stakeholder-driven solutions becomes urgent. This project challenges you to explore
how global supply chains—especially in the electronics sector—can evolve to become
engines of equity, resilience, and sustainability.

Project Objective


As part of a consulting team, your mission is to help multinational corporations — or even governments —
fundamentally rethink and redesign their approach to ethical sourcing and sustainable supply chains. You are
encouraged to explore the issue from diverse perspectives and define your own strategic path within this
broader challenge. Your solution may take the form of innovative policies, technological tools, partnership
models, or new frameworks — whatever you believe will create the most meaningful and scalable impact.

@ caciitg

Project Component
Ethical Labor Practices: How can companies ensure safe, fair, and inclusive working environments
across all supplier tiers, especially in countries with limited oversight?
Environmental Sustainability: What strategies can reduce the ecological footprint of electronics
production—from resource extraction to end-of-life disposal?
Supply Chain Transparency: How might emerging technologies support greater visibility, traceability,
and accountability?
Technology Integration: How can digital tools (AI, blockchain, IoT, etc.) proactively detect violations or
automate ESG reporting?
Stakeholder Accountability: What models engage not just corporations, but also governments,
consumers, NGOs, and workers in co-creating solutions?

Scope of Wor
Diagnostic Assessment: Evaluate current ethical and sustainability practices in global supply chains
using comparative benchmarking (e.g., Apple, Nike, Unilever, Fairphone, Nestlé).
Policy Framework: Recommend policy shifts or government interventions to strengthen ESG
compliance and enforcement.
Innovation Playbook: Identify and prototype technologies that enable real-time ESG monitoring, risk
detection, or supplier verification.
Supplier Engagement Strategy: Design programs to help suppliers build ESG capabilities through
incentives, training, and tools.
Collaboration Model: Propose industry-wide platforms for sharing best practices, harmonizing
standards, and fostering public-private cooperation.

Deliverable
A strategic plan or whitepaper outlining your approach and rationale.
A prototype (e.g., dashboard, digital tool, app) for supply chain monitoring or ESG compliance.
A supplier engagement toolkit with training materials, checklists, and incentive ideas.
A set of policy or regulatory recommendations to support ethical sourcing.
A comparative case study analysis and recommendations for scaling best practices.
A crisis response framework for addressing ESG violations or public scrutiny.

@ caciitg

Guiding Question
How can companies gain visibility into deeper supplier tiers where most violations occur
What are the trade-offs between voluntary codes of conduct and government mandates?
How might small firms adopt ESG practices without large budgets or dedicated compliance teams?
What types of incentives—regulatory, financial, reputational—are most effective for driving change?
How can we make ESG transparency not just a responsibility, but a competitive edge?

Why This Matters


Behind every smartphone, laptop, or wearable lies a web of decisions that affect lives, livelihoods, and the
planet. From cobalt mines in the Congo to assembly plants in Southeast Asia, the ethical burden of global
consumption often falls on the most vulnerable. Yet these systems can be reimagined. This is not just an
academic exercise—it’s an opportunity to design the future of responsible globalization. Your ideas could
influence real corporate policies, government strategies, or even tech solutions that shape how the world does
business.

Call for Action


You have the chance to turn critical thinking into impact. Approach this challenge not just as students, but as
future changemakers. Explore, question, create—and most importantly, imagine a world where global supply
chains are as just and sustainable as they are efficient.

Introduction



Addressing Domestic

Violence in India

Domestic violence is one of the gravest social challenges in India, impacting the safety,
dignity, and future of millions of women across socioeconomic strata. As per the National
Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), nearly 30% of Indian women aged 15–49 have experienced
domestic violence at least once. However, this is only the tip of the iceberg—countless
cases remain unreported due to cultural stigma, lack of legal awareness, or fear of
retaliation.

This issue is not just about violence in the home—it is a systemic failure that perpetuates
gender inequality, affects children, and hinders national development. The COVID-19
pandemic further highlighted vulnerabilities, with a significant spike in domestic abuse
during lockdown periods.

Project Objective


You are invited to act as Youth Policy Consultants to the Government of India. Your mission is to conduct
comprehensive research, scrape and analyze real-world data, and design innovative, practical, and
technology-driven solutions to combat domestic violence in India.

Your final deliverable will directly influence policymaking and public program development at state and national
levels.

Goals of the Project


Participants are expected to
Understand the Landscape: Analyze the scale, frequency, and geographic distribution of domestic
violence cases across Indian states using reliable public datasets and media sources
Investigate Root Causes: Study cultural, social, economic, and legal factors contributing to domestic
violence
Identify Gaps in Support: Assess the availability and effectiveness of current support systems like
helplines, shelters, and legal aid
Design Solutions: Propose actionable, data-backed strategies that prevent, address, and respond to
domestic violence.

5. Innovate with Technology: Leverage apps, AI, IoT, or data analytics to create safe reporting
channels, predictive models, or awareness platforms.
